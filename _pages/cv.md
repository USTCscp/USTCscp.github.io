Research experience
======
* An Extended Microlensing Method For IMBH Detection
  * Credit First author
  * Supervisor: Prof. Wentao Luo (USTC)
  * Time: October 2022 - 
  * State: Most of work are completed. Paper in preparation.
  * Abstract:We extend the Microlensing methodology to distinguish compact lensing objects much more massive than mundane stellar objects. Combining the separation angle between two source images and the event time scale, we derive an optical depth equation that constrains the mass of the lensing objects within the Milky Way. Furthermore, we devise an approach to give a lower mass limit to the lensing object based on distortion on the light curve. This work may contribute to the detection of IMBH.
  * Key words: microlensing, dark matter, IMBH.
  
* A High-performance Algorithm For Identifying Halos And Their Substructure 
  * Credit First author
  * Supervisor: Prof. Yu Rong (USTC)
  * Time: November 2022 - 
  * State: Still working
  * Abstract:We apply the efficient clustering algorithm OPTICS to cosmic simulation data to find cluster structures. Traditional cluster screening algorithms (e.g., Friends-of-Friends; FOF) require input parameters (such as the link length in the FOF algorithm), which affect the clustering output. In contrast, OPTICS can produce a reachability diagram without any influential parameters. We try to extract clusters from this reachability diagram, which indicates every particle's local density and neighbors.
  * Key words: Large-scale structure, halo finder.
